# Building AI-Powered Applications with Next.js

Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized how we build web applications. In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through building intelligent features using Next.js and modern AI services.

## Why AI in Web Applications?

Modern web applications need to be more than just static pages. Users expect intelligent interactions, personalized experiences, and automated workflows. AI integration makes this possible.

## Key AI Services for Next.js

### 1. OpenAI API
The OpenAI API provides access to powerful language models like GPT-4. Here's how to integrate it:

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

export async function generateResponse(prompt: string) {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
  });
  
  return completion.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

### 2. Pinecone Vector Database
For building RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems:

```typescript
import { Pinecone } from '@pinecone-database/pinecone';

const pinecone = new Pinecone({
  apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY,
});

export async function searchSimilarDocuments(query: string) {
  const index = pinecone.index('your-index');
  const queryResponse = await index.query({
    vector: await embedQuery(query),
    topK: 5,
  });
  
  return queryResponse.matches;
}
```

## Building a RAG System

Retrieval Augmented Generation combines document search with AI generation:

1. **Document Embedding**: Convert your documents to vectors
2. **Query Processing**: Embed user queries
3. **Similarity Search**: Find relevant documents
4. **Context Generation**: Use relevant documents as context for AI

## Voice Integration with Vapi

For voice-enabled applications:

```typescript
import { Vapi } from '@vapi-ai/web';

const vapi = new Vapi({
  apiKey: process.env.VAPI_API_KEY,
});

export async function createVoiceAssistant() {
  const assistant = await vapi.createAssistant({
    name: "Support Assistant",
    model: "gpt-4",
    voice: "shimmer",
    systemPrompt: "You are a helpful support assistant.",
  });
  
  return assistant;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for API keys
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for AI services
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits
4. **Caching**: Cache AI responses when appropriate
5. **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback to improve AI responses

## Performance Considerations

- Use streaming responses for better UX
- Implement proper loading states
- Consider using Edge Runtime for faster responses
- Cache embeddings to reduce API calls

## Conclusion

AI integration in Next.js applications opens up endless possibilities. Start with simple features and gradually build more complex systems. The key is to focus on user value and ensure your AI features enhance rather than complicate the user experience.

Remember: AI is a tool to enhance your application, not replace good UX design and user research.
